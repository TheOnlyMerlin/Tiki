TikiWiki User Contributed Themes Collection
-------------------------------------------

These themes are bundled seperately simply to reduce the footprint on
the Tiki installation.  Also, you may want to license your theme
differently.

If no license reference is found in your theme's README, lets assume its 
the same as Tiki, that's LGPL.

Remember to include your contact details.

Please note the following desired format:

/themename/README

/themename/styles/
* This contains everything that needs to be copied to your site's /styles/ folder

/themename/templates/styles/themename/
* This contains everything that needs to be copied to your site's /templates/styles/themename/ folder

The idea being you can just cp -R /themename/* /tikiroot/.
