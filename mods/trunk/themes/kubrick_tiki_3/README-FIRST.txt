This is a Tiki adaptation of the Kubrick theme (http://mambo.rhuk.net/) originally done by Michael Heilemann for the WordPress blog software. This update for Tiki 3 been tested with Tiki 3.0beta. Maintained by Gary Cunningham-Lee (chibaguy). For the latest information on and updates of the Kubrick theme for TikiCMS, visit http://zukakakina.com or http://themes.tikiwiki.org. 

This readme describes things to be aware of and do BEFORE installing/selecting this theme at your site, how to install the theme, and license information.

-=Before Installing/Selecting this theme=-

* Site Identity feature

The Site Identity feature (now part of "Look & Feel" as of TikiWiki 2) is fully supported by this theme.

* Menus

This theme can be used with any menu, as set by the Look & Feel menu option.


-=Page Header Images=-

One image is used for the header background. (It's actually the background image for a few nested divs, to provide the image end sections as well as the middle.) A logo image can be set in Look & Feel, or text can be used for the site title, input in the custom code box of the Look & Feel config page.

-=About the Left and Right Columns=-
The Kubrick theme normally uses a single side column, on the right. Previously, all modules were stacked on the right side. In this version, both side columns are supported in the normal Tiki way. But column-flipping (links to control side-column visibility) is supported, so site users can widen the center column area by turning off one or both side columns. Also the "Fullscreen" display is supported, which will display only center column content, without the sides or page header or footer.

-=Installation=-
Copy or upload kubrick.css and the kubrick images directory to the styles/ directory of your Tiki site.
Copy or upload the kubrick templates directory to the templates/styles/ directory of your Tiki site.
