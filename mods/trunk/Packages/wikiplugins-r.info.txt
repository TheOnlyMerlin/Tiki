Changelog:
0.1 initial package
0.2 Graphs also allowed inside wiki pages, as png images. Removed the need for StatWiki.r file. 
0.3 Png can be loaded in pages (allowed by local .htaccess file in ./temp folder)
0.4 Security checking enabled by default and many new optional params: security, wikisyntax and other graph params. Thanks LPH for your help. Params Filtered.
0.5 parsing xml files fixed. Wrap param added (and enabled by default). Since 0.5.1, calls to the r plugin don't require admin validation, and in addition, can't execute dangerous commands. A new sister plugin is added (rr) which allows executing potentially dangerous commands.
