Changelog:
0.1  initial package
0.2  Graphs also allowed inside wiki pages, as png images. Removed the need for StatWiki.r file. 
0.3  Png can be loaded in pages (allowed by local .htaccess file in ./temp folder)
0.4  Security checking enabled by default and many new optional params: security, wikisyntax and other graph params. Thanks LPH for your help. Params Filtered.
0.5  parsing xml files fixed. Wrap param added (and enabled by default). Since 0.5.1, calls to the r plugin don't require admin validation, and in addition, can't execute dangerous commands. A new sister plugin is added (rr) which allows executing potentially dangerous commands. Since 0.52, icon is added, and textarea box to allow inserting R code from the plugin helper is added.
0.60 Added basic codemirror css and js file for rsplus (so far, only copied from the Python ones). Further improvements to the highlighter for rsplus to come.
0.61 Removed codemirror css and js files since they are now part of Tiki 7. Plugin made compatible again with Tiki <7. Carriage returns allowed inside R code in pretty trackers through wiki page templates, because PluginR removes all br p /p tags from the content to be parsed by R. Thanks Jonnyb for tips.
0.62 Ported to work with Tiki7.x also (thanks jonnyb), and minor issue fixed with servers where R has no X11 support.
0.70 Added optional generation of SVG and/or PDF files from each plot, in order to allow producing high quality vectorial plots which can be enlarged or edited without loosing quality. Also minor enhancement added for better display of png images when inside tiki slideshows in Tiki 6.5+ and 7.2+.
0.71 Same value pairs for onefile param as with otehr params. Added language files (they work in Tiki8+).
0.72 Added the ability to create and display several png's when the R call wants to generate new graphs from any command and the user writes "# newgraph" before the new graph so that pluginR opens up the required new graphic device.
0.73 Creation of folders for temp only if they are missing (therefore removing the harmless but annoying warning when they exist already)
0.74 R icon shown also in Tiki9. Empty lines above figures from googleVis package removed (thanks RobertPlummer)
0.75 svg generation works again with this small change and r43765 to clean svn code (thanks changi and jyhem)
0.76 Fixing bug introduced in r41927 removing new lines with \n for way too many cases. New param added as removen, to allow the user to choose when to have them removed (like in charts created through googleVis R package)
0.77 Adding biocLite and shiny commands to Run apps in different ways in the list of monitored commands
0.78 File .RData created in the right folder in all cases. Clearing Tiki caches finally cleans also folders from PluginR under temp/cache. Param echo added to show an echo of the commands introduced. New params (and code) added also borrowed from PluginCode to let the user customize the echo output (caption, wrap, colors, ln).
0.79 Some minor refactoring, and better defaults when just param echo is set to 1 (defaults then: ln enabled, colors set to r, and caption as R code or RR code, depending on the type of plugin call). Reset the list of basic and advanced params for easier use.
