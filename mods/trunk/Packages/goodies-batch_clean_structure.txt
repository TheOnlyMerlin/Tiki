Description:
This batch allows to fix the position recorded in the database to have a linear progression of these positions
(this was seen in tiki-index.php - the number was incorrect)
* Installation: put the batch in the tikiwiki root - after use, better to move or delete the script
***** Dump your database - just in case
* Run the script from the brower
 - http://yoursite.com/batch_clean_structure.php?page_ref_id=x where x if the id of the structure
 - http://yoursite.com/batch_clean_structure.php to clean all the structures
* Move or remove the script from the tikiroot
